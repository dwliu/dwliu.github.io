        <p>I have been hesitated for a long time, because I haven’t decided which topic to write on. Of all the movies I had watched, I was especially touched by one: <em>Forrest Gump</em>.</p>
<p>For a long time since I was young, I don’t like watch movies, I just consider them boring and unintuitive, like the long novel—you have to take much energy before finishing the book, only to find that it tells merely a story, although it may be exciting and risking, and you gain almost nothing from it. After years of studying in my university, I eventually find that I was wrong: there are plenty of classic movies waiting for me, for example, <em>Forrest Gump</em>.</p>
<p>I benefit a lot from the movie. As I watched the movie, it was like that I was wandering in the seaside, where there are colorful shells on the sand, to pick each one is really good fortune. Although at first, it seems the movie was a little ridiculous. The leading character, Forrest Gump, with an IQ of only 75 and instinctive muscle problem, went through nearly all the events that America had experienced after World War Ⅱ, from Leonon to Kennedy, from Viet Nam to China, this unlucky man has achieved lots of incredible success, he is a football star, a war hero, and later a millionaire! I consider it to be deliberate, so as to reflect the director’s mind.</p>
<p>In the scene, Forrest Gump is molded into a clumsy and foolish man, and he was bullied as a child because of it, after he grow up, he still makes silly mistakes, gets teased ,some even unbelievable in my eyes. Meanwhile, by simply this process, the leading character shows us with integrity, honesty, bravery and loyalty, which are the most valuable characteristics in humane nature. From moment to moment, I am moved by him, I am hit by his deed, although he keep his clumsy all his life, his pure mind is haunting in me, just like the feather whirling, stirring, and flying over the azure heaven.</p>
<p>Accompanying Gump, there are two women around him: His mother and Jenny, and they play great roles in Gump’s life. I can still remember the last words Mum told him when she was dying: Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get. Since Gump was born, she has been stimulating his son. She believes that her son could perform well and not inferior to anybody else, although she is rigid in outlook and frailty in heart. She told Gump “Stupid is as stupid is!” When her son was refused to admission because of low intelligence, she didn’t give up and decided to teach him at home. Consequently Forrest Gump is cultivated in spite of no school record. The leading character then learned to struggle to his destiny according to what his mum told him in his unique way, and every step he gets in progress, his mum will be proud of him, for instance, when Gump was admitted to university for his base running in football, we can see the tears shed in her eyes, they are happy tears, delighted tears and proudful tears. Never had her been so proud of her son!</p>
<p>Another woman in his life is Jenny. They went to school together, played with each other, even grew up in mutual company. Jenny was the representative of times, she followed the trends, let out their rage, scrabble, appealed, and eventually abnegate with heart breaks. In spite of what Jenny had done behind Forrest, our leading character never gave up his love, never despaired or depressed, he was always cherishing the feeling deep in his heart, and he was always waiting for her Jenny coming back. I am deeply moved by Forrest, for his loyalty to love. When the world is filled with more and more substance and in shortage of true feelings, Forrest Gump sets us a spiritual example through his action, in tears we learn from him to hold our precious spiritual homestead.</p>
<p>The last important person in the movie was Bubo, Forrest’s best friend. He taught Forrest a lot about shrimp, instructed Forrest to be a millionaire at last when he returned to America. However, it is a pity he didn’t survive the war in Vietnam, and his body was forever left on the land of Vietnam. </p>
<p>Now I have watched the movies three times. The first time is by chance, I saw it on Mr. Liu Ray’s class, and I only got seen some parts of it. During last summer vacation, I saw it with my little brother at home for the second time. I just hope my little brother can learn something from it, more or less. I believe anyone can get the instructed part of his own from it. Then, the third time on Mr. Chen’s class. Each time I watch it, I obtain new inspiration.</p>
<p>All through his life, there is only one type of love that support Forrest Gump, that is mother love; He has no affection on any girl but Jenny, and he would display no passion before other girls for ever. In honor of his comrade Bubo, he took up shrimping as his career, and eventually became one millionaire after some bad fortune. During every step of his life, he will have one goal to pursue; therefore he spares no effort to struggle, constantly and unalterably, until the accomplishment of the goal, until the coming-forth of his next goal.</p>
<p>Many miracles occur in Forrest Gump’s life, but they are not magical, we have no need to adore him or envy him, because he ends up every success with his own effort. After all, the movie is imaginary; we needn’t take it too seriously. However, we should learn from Forrest Gump, from every side, to pursue our own life, and our own happiness.</p>
